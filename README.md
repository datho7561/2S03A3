# 2S03 Asssignment 3


This is the code for my third assignment as part of McMaster's C programming course, 2S03.

We were provided the header file `assignment3.h`, as well as descriptions of what each function should do.

The task was to work with singly linked lists and "HB Lists" in order to test our ability to work with pointers and dynamic memory allocation. We were to create a random HB List, which consists of a list of keys and singly linked lists. The keys in the HB node had to be increasing, and the keys in the singly linked lists also had to be increasing. We then would need to generate a flattened version of the list, which is a singly linked list containing all the keys of the HB list sorted in increasing value. We were not allowed to put all the keys into an array and sort the array, and instead were encouraged to make copies of the singly linked lists and merge them together.

My main program generates an HB List, prints it, then generates the flattened list.

We were required to submit only our `list.c` after it has been run through `clang-format`. I made a copy of this file called `formatted_list.c`
